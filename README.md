# ELEC2645 Unit 2 - University Study Planner

### 1. Introduction

This is a command-line application project implemented in C that helps `University students` manage their free time. It allows user to enter module details, add tasks with deadlines, automatically generate a weekly study timetable, record study durations, track mood, and save/load data.

### 2. Files
This project is divided into three main files.<br/>
1. `main.c` handles menu navigation
2. `funcs.c` contains all functions implementation
3. `funcs.h` contains all functions protoypes, struct difinitions, and global variable declarations<br/>

For File I/O, this program automatically saves `modules.dat`, `tasks.dat`, and `week.dat` in binary file `data.bin`.


### 3. Run 
You can run the application with `make test` then `./main.out`
